**Important information: Following the acquisition of Snips by Sonos, the Snips Console is not available anymore after January 31, 2020. As such, I have exported all data of the English version of this app from the Snips Console and made these available in the directory [console](https://github.com/koenvervloesem/snips-app-pick-something-random/tree/master/console) with the same MIT license as the rest of this project. This project has been archived. If you're searching for an alternative to Snips, I believe that [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/) is currently the best choice for an offline open source voice assistant.**

With this [Snips](https://snips.ai/) app, you can ask for random numbers and dates, to flip a coin and to roll a die or multiple dice.
